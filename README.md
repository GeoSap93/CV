This section includes my cv and my work in the university during the years 2015-2017.

My first work was in the use of different methods and techniques of Learning Analytics to estimate the educational results in learning environments.
Last, my dissertation "Facebook Use, Personality Characteristics and Academic Performance: A case study" examines the relationship of students' Facebook use and personality characteristics using the Big Five Personality Test.
